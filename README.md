Perspective is a web app that amasses and organizes geo-location based communities around sensitive issues where individuals can be honest about their opinions, beliefs, and experiences while keeping their anonimity/privacy.Once an active group passes a certain threshold in either topic population or activity then a SEED of that topic will be sent to another FERTILE (active PERSPECTIVE community) somewhere else in the world.Communities around these sensitive issues will be exposed to  experts, people that overcame topic related issues, and foundations that are attempting to solve the problem.Users can choose to either Donate to these foundations from anywhere in the world using Bitcoin or Choose to get Involved.
